I'm a 23-year-old CE student at Universidad de Guadalajara 🎓🎺, diving deep into cybersecurity and pentesting. 🔏🧪

My name is Manuel Balderas, but most of my friends call me Mane 👋. I'm currently in my final semester of Computer Engineering, and I'm deeply passionate about cybersecurity 👾. Although I'm still in the early stages of my ethical hacking journey 🕵, I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, and I'm excited to share my experiences here.

- Currently, I work as a Systems Security Administrator at IBM 🐝. My role has given me hands-on experience with the real-world challenges that companies face in securing their infrastructure, and it's something I truly enjoy.
- My goal 🎯 is to keep growing in the field, and I plan to pursue the [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) certification 🏆 within the next three years to further solidify my skills.
- In my free time, I enjoy coding 👨‍💻 and keeping up to date 📅 with the latest in the world of cybersecurity.

Through this blog, I aim to document my journey, share my write-ups, and offer insights into my path toward becoming a more skilled ethical hacker. I also hope these posts will be valuable to others starting out in this field—whether you're a fellow beginner or someone looking to refine your fundamental skills.
